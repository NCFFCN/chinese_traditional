"Great, Hunter!\nNow that we have access to the mall it's time to see what it looks like. You'll have to scout around and find the location of some stores.\nWhat do you say? Is this mission familiar to you?\nI don't understand how that could be possible.\nWhatever, back to us... Go to the mall and find these stores.",Quest descriptions,1024,"太好了, 獵人!\n現在我們可以進入購物中心了, 是時候看看它是什麼樣子了。你得四處偵察, 找到一些商店的位置。\n你說什麼? 這個任務你熟悉嗎?\n我不明白這怎麼可能。\n不管怎樣, 回到我們…去購物中心找到這些商店。"
"Haha! Great, Hunter!\nThe plan worked like a charm! Now all we have to do is explore the village and find the purple crystal.\nThere should be a few Ghouls left in the village, I don't think that will be a problem for you.",Quest descriptions,1024,"哈哈! 太好了, 獵人!\n計劃非常成功! 現在我們只需要探索村莊, 找到紫色水晶。\n村里應該還剩下一些食屍鬼, 我想這對你來說不成問題。"

Grigoriy's ring,Quest names,64,"格里戈里的戒指"
"Ok Hunter! First job for you.\nThe Green Army does not yet know that you are now part of the Crimson Corporation, we must take advantage of this opportunity.\nGo to their bunker area, where Artemovich is, and place a CCTV camera.\nTry to hide it among the shelves.",Quest descriptions,1024,"好的, 獵人! 你的第一項任務。\n綠色軍團還不知道你現在是赤紅公司的成員, 我們必須抓住這個機會。\n去他們的碉堡, 阿爾特莫維奇就在那裡, 安裝一個閉路電視攝像頭。\n盡量把它藏在架子中間。"
My leg is still not fully healed.\nThanks to my experience I can still move through the forest somehow.\nCould you bring me some medicine? It would heal faster,Quest descriptions,1024,"我的腿還沒完全好。\n多虧了經驗, 我還能設法在森林裡走動。\n你能帶些藥給我嗎? 那樣會好得更快。"
"Hey Hunter!\nListen... I have a big favor to ask of you....\nThe Green Army soldier who shot me in the leg is called Bogdanov, that damn bastard must pay....\nNow I think he is in the Makeshift camp, you know what you have to do....\nThank you Hunter",Quest descriptions,1024,"嘿, 獵人!\n聽著……我有個大忙想拜託你……\n那個射中我腿的綠色軍團士兵叫博格達諾夫, 那個該死的混蛋必須付出代價……\n現在我覺得他在臨時營地, 你知道你該怎麼做……\n謝謝你, 獵人。"
Oh! Oh! Can you do something for Mr. Junk?\nNow that Grigoriy has come back to life he would love to get his ring back.\nMr. Junk hid it in the swamp before he came to this place.\nIf you do this for Mr. Junk then he will sell you some of his treasure.\nNo! No! No! Mr. Junk loves his treasure...\nOh! Oh! But it's more important to make Grigoriy happy.\nYes! Yes! Yes!\nYou bring Mr. Junk the ring and he'll sell you some of his treasure.\nMr. Junk will also give you this costume he found,Quest descriptions,1024,"哦! 哦! 你能為「垃圾」先生做點什麼嗎?\n既然格里戈里已經復活了, 他很想拿回他的戒指。\n「垃圾」先生…「垃圾」先生在來這裡之前把它藏在沼澤裡。\n如果你幫「垃圾」先生做這件事, 他會賣給你一些他的寶藏。\n不! 不! 不! 「垃圾」先生很喜歡他的寶藏…\n哦! 哦! 但讓格里戈里開心更重要。\n好! 好! 好!\n你把戒指帶給「垃圾」先生, 他會賣給你一些他的寶藏。\n「垃圾」先生還會把他找到的這套服裝給你。"

"Ok Soldier! Some of my trusted men were part of a convoy that was carrying equipment.\nThey were ambushed in the swamp and from the last radio contact it seems to have been the Crimson Corporation, which is very strange since very few people knew about this convoy...\nHopefully they are just bandits otherwise I have to consider the idea that there is a spy in our ranks...\nGo to the swamp, find the convoy and see what you can find out.",Quest text,1024,"好的, 士兵! 我信任的幾個人當時正隨一個運送裝備的車隊前來。\n他們在沼澤地裡遭到伏擊, 根據最後的無線電聯繫, 似乎是赤紅公司派來的, 這很奇怪, 因為很少有人知道這個車隊……\n希望他們只是匪徒, 否則我不得不懷疑我們隊伍裡有間諜……\n去沼澤地, 找到什麼車隊, 你找到什麼。"
"Thanks to the retaliation we now have some time to build an outpost in the makeshift camp.,Your orders are to go to the industrial area and find a bag of cement.\nI think you can find one in the port area, where all those disused concrete blocks are.",Quest text,1024,"多虧了這次報復, 我們現在有時間在臨時營地裡建造一個前哨站。你的任務是去工業區找一袋水泥。\n我想你可以在港口區找到一個, 那裡有很多廢棄的混凝土塊。"
"After the recent events at the Mall, the Green Army requested many reinforcements in the field.\nWe are prepared for this...\nYou must eliminate all Green Army captains, there is one on each map.\nGood luck Hunter! You'll need it...",Quest text,1024,"在最近購物中心發生的事件之後, 綠色軍團請求大量增援。\n我們已經做好了準備……\n你必須消滅所有綠色軍團上尉, 每張地圖上都有一個。\n祝你好運, 獵人! 你會需要它的……"
"Ah poor man... So when you arrived he was still alive and reported that the Green Army is heading toward the mall?\nThey probably want to build a base there.\nOk Hunter! We must have eyes inside the mall.\nKeep these transmitters, you'll have to place them in three different locations. The first two are inside the mall, near the main entrance and the east entrance. Near these entrances there are monitoring rooms, you have to place the transmitters on those monitors.\nThe third location is in the underground parking lot, in the central area. There should be a monitoring room there as well.\nGood luck!",Quest text,1024,"啊, 可憐的傢伙……這麼說你到的時候他還活著, 並且報告說綠色軍團正朝購物中心進發?\n他們可能想在那裡建立一個基地。\n好的, 獵人! 我們必須在購物中心里安插眼線。\n保留這些發射器, 你必須將它們放置在三個不同的位置。"
"Soldier!\nMy men have reported a large amount of Crimson Corporation soldiers present everywhere. There are Crimson Captains in the field, one on each map. Your task will be to eliminate them.\nGet ready Soldier... It will be a bloodbath...",Quest text,1024,"士兵!\n我的士兵報告說, 到處都有大量赤紅公司的士兵。戰場上駐紮著赤紅公司的上尉, 每張地圖上都有一位。你的任務是消滅他們。\n準備好, 士兵……這將是一場血腥屠殺……"
"Good job Hunter! Now my men will take care of cleaning up the place and make it our outpost.\nIn the meantime you can take care of another matter. It seems that the Green Army has discovered the CCTV camera you planted in their bunker area.\nThey have begun to scour their soldiers and I think they have discovered one of our spies working in their ranks.\nThe last known location is in the swamp, go there and see if you can find it before the Green Army.",Quest text,1024,"幹得好, 獵人! 現在我的人會負責清理這個地方, 並把它變成我們的前哨。\n與此同時, 你可以處理另一件事。綠色軍團似乎發現了你在他們碉堡里安裝的閉路電視攝像頭。\n他們已經開始搜查他們的士兵, 我認為他們發現了我們潛伏在他們隊伍中的一名間諜隊中的一名間諜n。"
"Well done soldier!\nNow you have to deal with that bastard. His name is Ermolai Vlasov, he has been a Green Army recruit for a few weeks.\nI must say the son of a bitch did well, it's not easy to fool me.\nMy men spotted him but he managed to escape, now he is near the makeshift camp.\nKilling on sight soldier, no mercy. Once eliminated take his dogtag too, let's prepare a gift for Reynard...",Quest text,1024,"幹得好, 士兵!\n現在你得對付那個混蛋。他叫埃爾莫萊·弗拉索夫, 幾週前才加入綠色軍團。\n我得說, 這混蛋幹得真不錯, 我可沒那麼容易糊弄過去。\n我的人發現了他, 但他設法逃脫了, 現在就在臨時營地附近。\n見人就殺人就殺了禮物給他幹掉。"
"OK Soldier! The outpost is almost ready.\nA trusted man of mine is leading operations at the outpost, and I know that the Crimson Corporation is about to eliminate him.\nWhat you need to do is to eliminate the Crimson Corporation assassins present inside the mall. From my information there should be three of them.\nThe first one should be inside the LIO-JU clothing store.\nThe second in the area where the Abibas shoe store and the Tools store are.\nThe third in the TECH Store, next to the GUNS Store.\nGood luck soldier, do a clean job.",Quest text,1024,"好的, 士兵! 哨站快準備好了。\n我一個親信正在哨站指揮行動, 我知道赤紅公司就要除掉他了。\n你得把購物中心裡的赤紅公司刺客都除掉。據我所知, 應該有三個。\n第一個應該在LIO-JU'n。\n第二個服裝店在Abibas鞋店和工具店附近。"
It's time to see what's left in the GUNS store in the mall. Go there and look for a crate with equipment.\nMaybe we can get some new equipment,Quest text,1024,"現在該去看看購物中心裡的槍店還剩下什麼了。去那裡找一個裝有裝備的箱子。\n也許我們可以得到一些新裝備。"
Nice Work Hunter!\nNow it is only a matter of time before we receive information about their movements. Your next task is to eliminate some Green Army sergeants.\nThey will definitely be replaced but this will create some disorganization in their ranks and we will have some time for our operations.,Quest text,1024,"獵手, 幹得好!\n現在, 我們收到他們動向的情報只是時間問題。你的下一個任務是消滅一些綠色軍團中士。\n他們肯定會被替換, 但這會擾亂他們的隊伍, 讓我們有時間進行行動。"
"We know that the Green Army is building a new outpost in the makeshift camp but at the moment we do not know the exact location.\nI'm asking you to go out on scout, find the outpost, and place a GPS signal.\nFor now there shouldn't be many Green Army soldiers yet so you should make it on your own.",Quest text,1024,"我們知道綠色軍團正在臨時營地裡建立一個新的哨所, 但目前我們還不知道具體位置。\n我要求你出去偵察, 找到哨所, 並放置GPS信號。\n目前綠色軍團士兵應該不多, 所以你應該自己動手。"
"Good job on that spy, Soldier!\nNow we can get on with the next move, go recon inside the mall and look for a fairly empty place that can become our outpost on the spot.\nFrom the mall map, it looks like the area south of the loading/unloading area of the supermarket is empty.\nGo there and see if it is still like that.",Quest text,1024,"士兵, 你這個間諜做得真棒!\n現在我們可以進行下一步了, 去購物中心內部偵察, 尋找一個比較空曠的地方, 可以就地作為我們的哨所。\n從購物中心地圖上看, 超市裝卸區南邊的區域似乎是空的。\n去那裡看看那裡是否還是空的。"
"The Crimson corporation attacked the outpost we were building, by now I know for a fact that there is a spy and fortunately I sent more men than they needed and because of that they were able to repel the attack.\nSurely that filthy rat must have put some CCTV cameras here in the bunker, see if you can find some.",Quest text,1024,"赤紅公司襲擊了我們正在建造的前哨站, 現在我確定他們確實有間諜, 幸運的是我派出了比他們所需更多的人手, 因此他們才得以抵禦襲擊。\n那隻骯髒的老鼠肯定在地堡裡裝了一些閉路電視攝像頭, 看看你能不能找到一些。"
"Okay soldier! The location you found should work well.\nYour next goals are to find a generator inside the mall and trucks.\nI think you can find the generator in the northeast area inside the mall.\nMeanwhile, there should be many trucks in the underground parking lot in the north area where the back exit is.\nOnce you find them, place GPS markers, my men will take care of the rest.",Quest text,1024,"好的, 士兵! 你找到的位置應該沒問題。\n你的下一個目標是在購物中心裡找到一台發電機和卡車。\n我認為你可以在購物中心內的東北區域找到發電機。\n與此同時, 後門所在的北區地下停車場應該有很多卡車。\n一旦你找到它們, 就放置剩下的事情。"
"Good job Hunter!\nWe are already getting the first pictures, it looks like the Green Army is setting up near the shoe store located on the west side of the Mall.\nThey have tampered with the mall cameras in that area so we are blind.\nGo there and place a CCTV camera inside the shoe store so we can see their movements.",Quest text,1024,"幹得好, 獵人!\n我們已經收到了第一批照片, 看起來綠色軍團正在購物中心西側的鞋店附近紮營。\n他們篡改了購物中心那一帶的攝像頭, 所以我們什麼都看不見。\n去鞋店裡裝個閉路電視攝像頭, 這樣我們就能監視他們的一舉一動了。"
"Damn!\nThen it is very likely that there is a spy among my men, I will see what I can find out.\nIn the meantime, we are planning a retaliation against the Crimson Corporation.\nDo your part soldier, you must eliminate some targets.",Quest text,1024,"該死!\n那麼我的手下很可能有間諜, 我去看看能不能查出來。\n與此同時, 我們正在計劃對赤紅公司進行報復。\n士兵們, 做好你的本分吧, 你必須消滅一些目標。"
"There is movement at the new Green Army base in the mall.\nIt seems that a Green Army sergeant has arrived on site to coordinate operations.\nTry to eliminate him Hunter, if you do we may take control of that area",Quest text,1024,"購物中心裡的新綠色軍團基地有動靜。\n看來綠色軍團中士已經抵達現場協調行動。\n試著除掉他, 獵人, 如果你做到了, 我們就能控制那片區域。"
"Hey Hunter!\nThanks again for clearing the harbor!\nIf you want a job I have one for you, one of the convoys that was carrying supplies is delayed.\nThe last known location is in the forest, go there and find out what's going on.",Quest text,1024,"嘿, 獵人!\n再次感謝你清理港口!\n如果你想找個活兒幹, 我有個活兒給你, 其中一個運送補給的車隊延誤了。\n最後已知的地點在森林裡, 去那裡看看發生了什麼事。"
"Damn it! Was it the bandits then?\nI'm not surprised, they are creating quite a few problems for our supplies.\nHelp us to fix the situation Hunter, clear out the bandits.",Quest text,1024,"該死! 那是匪徒幹的嗎?\n我一點也不驚訝, 他們給我們的補給製造了不少麻煩。\n幫我們解決這個問題, 獵人, 把匪徒都清理掉。"
"Were they all torn apart then?\nMost likely it was a Big, another team just spotted one in the swamp.\nI don't want to risk any more men, so the job is yours Hunter.",Quest text,1024,"他們都被拆散了嗎?\n很可能是一隻巨獸, 另一支隊伍剛剛在沼澤裡發現了一隻。\n我不想再讓其他人冒險了, 所以這個任務交給你了, 獵人。"
"While disembarking at the industrial area port, my men forgot a briefcase with electronic components in it.\nDamned recruits, in such an emergency situation the Crimson Corporation sent infants.\nGo there and retrieve it Hunter, it should be in the southeastern part of the harbor.",Quest text,1024,"在工業區港口下船時, 我的手下忘了一個裝有電子元件的公文包。\n該死的新兵, 在這種緊急情況下, 赤紅公司竟然派嬰兒來。\n去那裡把它取回來, 獵人, 它應該在港口的東南部。"
"Mmm... Okay it seems that Hunter had found the documents but then he ran into Lazar, the bandit leader in the forest village.\nI'm sure he still has the documents; he must have hidden them somewhere inside the police station.\nGo there and look for them....\nOh and while you're at it, kill Lazar too. This is not the first time he has interfered with our operations",Quest text,1024,"嗯……好吧, 看來獵人找到了文件, 但他後來遇到了森林村莊的強盜頭目拉扎爾。\n我敢肯定他現在還保管著文件；他肯定把它們藏在警察局的某個地方了。\n去那裡找找……。\n哦, 對了, 順便把拉扎爾也殺了。這可不是他第一次幹擾我們的行動了。"
"I sent some of my men to clear out the entrance to the motel. There seems to be a ghoul infestation in the parking lot. Our goal is to eliminate it and retrieve some documents from a soldier who died long ago, when the makeshift camp was still inhabited and we didn't know that radiation could spread that far.\nHe was one of my advisers, his name was Yuli Antonov.\nHis body should be in one of the motel rooms.\nIt will be some time before we intervene so the job is yours if you are interested, Hunter",Quest text,1024,"我派了一些人去清理汽車旅館的入口。停車場裡似乎有食屍鬼出沒。我們的目標是消滅它們, 並從一位很久以前就死了的士兵那裡取回一些文件, 當時臨時營地還有人居住, 我們不知道輻射會擴散到那麼遠。"
"I have an easy job if you're interested, it's about scouting.\nYou need to head into the makeshift camp and find the old motel, check for any threats.",Quest text,1024,"如果你有興趣的話, 我的工作很簡單, 就是偵察。\n你需要前往臨時營地, 找到那家舊汽車旅館, 檢查是否有任何威脅。"
"\nA Hunter was working for us near the forest. He hasn't been heard from for more than 24 hours now; I think he's dead by now.\nHis job was to find out what happened to the documents we were transporting to the bunker.\nHis last known location was in the forest village in the northern area.\nSearch for his body and bring back what you find, let's see if he discovered anything before he died.",Quest text,1024,"\n一位獵人在森林附近為我們工作。他已經超過24小時沒有消息了；我想他現在已經死了。\n他的工作是查明我們運送到地堡的文件發生了什麼事。\n他最後已知的位置是在北部地區的森林村莊。\n尋找他的屍體, 把你找到的東西帶回來, 讓我們看看他死前是否發現了什麼。"
"Damn!\nOne of our scout teams has just been attacked by something in the swamp, these are their last coordinates.\nHurry up Hunter!\nMaybe someone is still alive...",Quest text,1024,"該死!\n我們的一支偵察小隊剛剛在沼澤裡遭到某種東西的襲擊, 這是他們最後的坐標。\n快點, 獵人!\n也許有人還活著……"
"The Barman told me about you; you seem to have potential.\nThe sawmill in the forest is occupied by bandits, inside there is a safe, we believe it contains important information for us.\nI need you to head there and bring back the contents of the safe.\nI think you can find the location of the sawmill easily in your map, it is a paved area.\nWhat information does the safe contain you say?\nIt's none of your business Hunter, learn to stand your ground and follow orders.",Quest text,1024,"酒保跟我提過你；你看起來很有潛力。\n森林裡的鋸木廠被強盜佔領了, 裡面有一個保險箱, 我們相信裡面有對我們來說很重要的資訊。\n我需要你去那裡把保險箱裡的東西帶回來。\n我想你可以在地圖上輕鬆找到鋸木廠的位置, 那是一片鋪砌的東西帶回來。\n我想你可以在地圖上輕鬆找到鋸木廠的位置, 那是一片鋪砌的區域。"

I highly doubt that he returned with the Crimson Corporation, too afraid of the consequences.\nI don't think he went far; he must be holed up somewhere in the industrial zone.\nI know the pricipal Oil Factory facility in the industrial zone has some very secure locked rooms, I would start looking for him there....",Quest descriptions,1024,"想了解更多關於水晶的資訊嗎, 獵人? 現在你只是一個普通人, 對它無能為力。\n我會把我的靈能頭盔給你, 它過去一直對我很有用。然而, 要讓它發揮作用, 它需要一些調整, 採用赤紅公司在扎科夫進行研究時使用的相同技術。\n在臨時營地的實驗室裡有一部電梯, 可以帶你到他們以前進行實驗時使用的相同技術。\n在臨時營地的實驗室裡有一部電梯, 可以帶你到他們以前進行實驗的地方, 但是要卡一切都變得一團糟之後, 赤紅公司封鎖了電梯。公司一起回來了, 因為他太害怕後果了。"

"As you know, years after the closure of the nuclear power plant, the Crimson Corporation detected a high level of strange radiation coming from underground and reached an agreement with the local government to install a research laboratory.\nUnder the ground, they discovered a cavity containing purple crystals, responsible for this radiation.\nThe research continued for several years, leading to discoveries that enabled significant advances in the pharmaceutical and biological sectors, turning the company into the largest multinational in the world.\nSo far, it would all seem legitimate, but the documents show that the Crimson Corporation had numerous contracts with world governments for the development of prototype weapons.\nI believe it is from these contracts that the company made its fortune.\nMoreover, the long-term effects of the drugs derived from these discoveries on the population are still unclear.\nIndeed, the Crimson Corporation has never been transparent about its research, but their products are so innovative that no one, among those who matter, has ever asked too many questions about their origin and effects.\n\nA few hours before the explosion at the nuclear power plant, a strange anomaly appeared in the crystals being studied, triggering general panic.\nIt seems that the commander-in-chief of the plant insisted on interacting with the anomaly, and that is when Frolov escaped, taking the documents with him.\nThe Crimson Corporation's instruments were all down and incessantly repeated the same sequence of numbers:\n\n0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0\n\nIt is unclear from the documents what actually triggered the explosion, but one possible cause is the forced interaction with the anomaly, rather than taking the time to work out an operational plan.\nGetting back to us, the only way to reach the anomaly is through the Watcher's HQ in Zakov, from where an underground line leads to the nuclear power plant.\nOnce you reach the anomaly, don't be fooled by what it will tell you....\nDecipher the code and input the result... And this will all be over.\nI can't tell you any more, Hunter, now it's your turn.","User Interface, interaction with NPC",4096,"如你所知, 核電站關閉多年後, 赤紅公司檢測到地下有高濃度的奇怪輻射, 並與當地政府達成協議, 建立一個研究實驗室。\n他們在地下發現了一個含有紫色晶體的空腔, 這就是輻射的來源。\n這項研究持續了數年, 其發現推動了製藥和生物領域的重大進步, 使該公司成為當時最大的跨國企業。\n到目前為止, 這一切似乎都是合法的, 但文件顯示, 克里姆森公司與世界各國政府簽訂了多份合同, 用於開發原型武器。\n我相信, 公司正是靠這些合約發了財。\n此外, 基於這些發現而生產的藥物對人類的長期影響尚不清楚。\n事實上, 克里姆森公司從未公開其研究成果, 但他們的產品如此具有創新性, 以至於在那些重要人物中, 沒有人對其來源和影響提出過多質疑。\n\n核電廠爆炸前幾個小時, 正在研究的晶體中出現了一種奇怪的異常現象, 引發了普遍的恐慌。\n似乎核電廠總司令堅持要與這種異常現象互動, 而就在那時, 弗羅洛夫帶著文件逃走了。\n克里姆森公司的儀器全部關閉, 並不斷重複相同的數字序列:\n\n0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0nn 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0\n\n從文件中尚不清楚爆炸的真正原因, 但一個可能的原因是被迫與異常互動, 而不是花時間制定作戰計畫。\n回到我們這裡, 到達異常的唯一方法是通過位於扎科夫的觀察者總部, 從那裡有一條地下線路通往核電站。\n一旦你到達異常, 不要被它告訴你的東西所欺騙……\n破解代碼並輸入結果……一切都結束了。\n我不能再告訴你了, 獵人, 現在輪到你了。"
